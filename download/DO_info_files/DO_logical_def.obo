Along with water, sufferers also lose dangerous amounts of important salts, electrolytes, and other nutrients. There are at least four types of diarrhea: secretory diarrhea, osmotic diarrhea, motility-related diarrhea, and inflammatory diarrhea." [url:http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea#Types_of_diarrhea]

def: "A lung disease that is characterized as a genetic disorder caused by defective production of alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT), leading to decreased A1AT activity in the blood and lungs, and deposition of excessive abnormal A1AT protein in liver cells. Alpha-1 antitrypsin works to protect the lungs from a naturally occuring destructive enzyme that is produced by the lungs in response to infections and toxins (such as cigarette smoke). Without enough A1AT, these enzymes slowly destroy the lung tissue causing emphysema. The symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, rhonchi, and rales."

The worm emerges as a whitish filament in the center of a painful ulcer, accompanied by inflammation and frequently by secondary bacterial infection."

def: "Aortic valve stenosis is a aortic valve disease caused by the incomplete opening of the aortic valve. The aortic valve controls the direction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. When in good working order, the aortic valve does not impede the flow of blood between these two spaces. Under some circumstances, the aortic valve becomes narrower than normal, impeding the flow of blood. This is known as aortic valve stenosis, or aortic stenosis, often abbreviated AS."

def: "Mitral valve stenosis is a rheumatic disease of mitral valve characterized by the narrowing of the orifice of the mitral valve of the heart. Most cases of mitral stenosis are due to disease in the heart secondary to rheumatic fever and the consequent rheumatic heart disease. Less common causes of mitral stenosis are calcification of the mitral valve leaflets, and as a form of congenital heart disease. However, there are primary causes of mitral stenosis that emanate from a cleft mitral valve. Other causes include Bacterial endocarditis where the vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis."

This syndrome occurs in patients who have a marked disturbance of consciousness such as that resulting from a drug overdose, seizures, a massive cerebrovascular accident, or the use of anesthesia. Aspiration of gastric contents results in a chemical burn of the tracheobronchial tree and pulmonary parenchyma, causing an intense parenchymal inflammatory reaction. The symptoms range from a non-productive cough to tachypnea, bronchospasm, bloody or frothy sputum, and respiratory distress 2-5 hrs after aspiration."

For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
